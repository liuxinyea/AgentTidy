## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Adaptive, terminal-friendly Unicode tables for the human-facing CLI output,
  with readable byte units and status colours; `--json` remains unchanged for
  automation.
- Versioned JSON envelopes (`agenttidy.cli.v1`) for every CLI machine-output
  command, including its command name and explicit `read-only` mode.
- Pure application-level workspace preview admission checks with regression
  coverage for the exact-session and WorkBuddy automation-reference gates;
  this is reserved for the future GUI and deliberately not exposed by the CLI.
- Initial Codex read-only provider adapter: detects the shared Codex state
  root, reports inspection facts and scans rollout JSONL `session_meta`
  records without reading transcript bodies. It reads the documented
  `state_5.sqlite.threads` index read-only to enrich session metadata; an
  unavailable or inconsistent index degrades diagnostics, while malformed
  rollouts remain blocked by default.
- Initial Claude Code CLI read-only provider adapter: discovers the verified
  `~/.claude` root and scans only top-level project transcripts. A transcript
  and its same-named side directory form one measured Session resource;
  filename/session-id mismatches remain blocked by default.
- Initial WorkBuddy read-only provider adapter: scans only the verified
  transcript file set and reports database journal facts without querying
  session lifecycle. Claude Desktop is discovered as a second Claude Code
  installation and scans only embedded transcript mirrors, excluding VM,
  credential, audit and user-output paths.
- Phase 4 read-only application/CLI path: static registration of the three
  providers and functional `doctor`, `scan`, and `sessions` commands. Cleanup
  is intentionally a future GUI-only workflow, not a CLI subcommand.
- End-to-end CLI golden baselines: 12 committed snapshots under
  `apps/cli/tests/golden/` (3 providers × 3 commands + 3 empty-home
  regressions) lock the `agenttidy.cli.v1` envelope against the existing
  sanitized fixtures. Absolute paths, completion timestamps, the
  agent-running flag, session lifecycle state and the `platform` label are
  normalised to placeholders so a single golden set covers macOS and
  Windows CI runners; the locked contract includes `thread-index-unavailable`
  on Codex scans, `workbuddy-db-unavailable` on WorkBuddy inspections and
  the four workspace-safety booleans on default-workspace resources.
- Phase 5 GUI read-only experience: Tauri 2 IPC bridge
  (`apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/commands.rs`) forwarding `doctor` /
  `scan` / `detect` to `agenttidy-application`, plus a three-view React
  shell (Overview / Sessions / Diagnostics) per Start.md §6.1/§6.2/§6.4
  with hand-written TS types in `apps/desktop/src/types.ts` matching the
  Rust serde shapes. Auto-scan on mount plus a manual Refresh button;
  empty installs route to a dedicated `Empty` panel. Cleanup actions
  (§6.3 Review & Tidy) remain a Phase 6 deliverable.
- Phase 6 cleanup model (framework-only): typed domain vocabulary in
  `crates/core/src/cleanup.rs` (three-level RiskLevel, CleanupUnit /
  CleanupPlan / CleanupItem, §12.2 revalidation precondition kinds,
  tagged CleanupLocator + §16.3 CleanupEvent); `AgentProviderAdapter`
  gained `build_cleanup_units` / `validate_cleanup_unit` (default: empty
  — no provider is cleanup-enabled until Phase 7); Application API
  gained the pure `cleanup_policy_evaluate`, `cleanup_plan_from_snapshots`,
  `cleanup_revalidate`, and fingerprint-guarded `cleanup_execute`; an
  append-only fsynced audit log at `$HOME/.agenttidy/operations.jsonl`;
  `agenttidy.gui.v1` IPC envelopes over three Tauri commands
  (`cleanup_preview` / `cleanup_revalidate` / `cleanup_execute`); and the
  GUI's Tidy tab implementing the two-confirmation flow with the Mac
  cleaner review layout (Recommended / Caution / Off-limits badges,
  per-provider groups, typed CONFIRM modal). `docs/safety/workspace-cleanup.md`
  now enumerates the §12.2 revalidation triggers, the audit-log schema,
  and the Trash vs ProviderOperation boundary. The CLI stays read-only —
  no cleanup subcommand.
- GUI bilingual (zh/en) internationalization: a hand-rolled i18n layer
  (`apps/desktop/src/i18n/`) with `en.ts` as source of truth and `zh.ts`
  typed as `Record<TranslationKey, string>` — missing/extra keys fail
  `tsc -b`, so `pnpm build:desktop` is the catalog-completeness gate.
  First launch detects `navigator.language`, the header carries an
  EN / 中文 toggle persisted in `localStorage`, and `<html lang>` follows
  the active locale. Static UI, frontend-mapped enum labels (status /
  capability / lifecycle / risk / confidence / severity / outcome) and
  the Phase 7 banner are fully localized; backend `ScanProblem` messages
  map to Chinese by stable code/path-suffix with English fallback, while
  cleanup reasons and anyhow errors stay English until Phase 7. Shared
  `format.ts` consolidates the previously copy-pasted `humanBytes` and
  locale-formats the three timestamp columns.
- Documented the future default-workspace cleanup gate: exact exclusive
  session ownership, no Git repository or shared references, OS Trash only,
  revalidation, risk disclosure, and two independent user confirmations.
- Added read-only accounting for the verified Codex and WorkBuddy default
  workspace roots; CLI scan reports their footprint separately from sessions.
- Development progress changelog at `docs/CHANGELOG.md`: a Phase 0–8
  milestone view with current work, verification blockers and maintenance
  conventions; README now links to it.
- Initial project skeleton: Rust workspace (core, application, infrastructure,
  provider-api, test-support crates; workbuddy / claude-code / codex provider
  crates; `agenttidy` CLI with placeholder subcommands), Tauri 2 + React
  desktop app shell, pnpm workspace, CI (macOS / Windows), docs and provider
  investigation placeholders.
- Provider investigation (Phase 0): filled `docs/providers/{claude-code,codex,workbuddy}.md`
  from real macOS samples — session storage structures, SQLite schemas,
  resource dependency graphs, archive semantics, atomic cleanup unit candidates
  and known risks. AGENTS.md + CLAUDE.md instruction files.
- Provider investigation update: default agent workspace directories outside
  state roots (`~/Documents/Codex/`, `~/WorkBuddy/` incl. nested `.workbuddy/`
  agent state) — detection must scan multiple common locations (Documents,
  home, app install), workspaces classify as Blocked/report-only; WorkBuddy
  user-chosen cwds with spaces/CJK verified; per-session sidecar files
  (`<uuid>.meta.json`, `<uuid>.file-rollback.ndjson`) documented.
- Provider investigation update (Windows 10, 2026-09-20): verified state
  roots for all three in-scope providers. New
  `docs/providers/claude-desktop.md` documents Claude Desktop
  (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Claude-3p\`, ~10 GB dominated by a Linux VM rootfs) as
  the **second `claude-code` installation** (not a separate `ProviderId`).
  `docs/providers/windows-path-matrix.md` records the per-installation
  path matrix. Codex CLI + Codex Desktop share one state root and are
  modelled as a single `codex` installation. `docs/providers/phase0-windows-{summary,complete,final}.md`
  archive the full investigation.
- Sanitized Phase 0 fixtures (`fixtures/<provider>/config/directory-tree.json`
  + `fixtures/<provider>/sessions/sample-session.jsonl` for each of
  `workbuddy`, `claude-code`, `codex`). Directory skeletons are depth-1
  with zero paths/PII; session JSONLs preserve schema fields and line
  types but drop all message content, paths, identity files, trace IDs
  and usage payloads. UUIDs are kept because they are schema-relevant
  for session-link tests.

### Fixed (Phase 1 review, installation-model alignment)

- Native-trash test now skips its environment-dependent assertion when a
  headless macOS session has no Finder service; production code still returns
  the platform error and remains fail-closed.
- `SessionId` doc corrected: uniqueness is per *installation*, not per
  provider — the same id may legitimately appear in both `claude-code`
  installations (Desktop mirrors CLI transcripts); dedup by
  `(provider, session id)` is the application layer's job.
- `AgentInstallation.id` now documents the `<provider>:<role>` naming
  convention; test fixtures renamed `claude-code:default` →
  `claude-code:cli` to match it (5 occurrences).
- Removed unused `Session::CAPABILITY_TOPIC` const and the
  keep-import-alive `unused_topic_import_is_for_docs` test.

### Added (Phase 1: read-only core)

- `agenttidy-core` domain model: `ProviderId` (closed set, fail-closed parse),
  `AgentInstallation`/`Platform`/`InstallationStatus`, `CapabilityStatus`/
  `CapabilityTopic`/`AgentCapabilities` (missing topic ⇒ Unsupported),
  `Session`/`SessionId`/`ProjectRef`/`SessionLifecycle` (archived-as-signal),
  `Resource`/`ResourceKind`/`Ownership`/`ResourceLocator`/`ManagedBy`,
  `SizeInfo`/`SizeConfidence` (conservative merge, no fake precision),
  `AgentSnapshot`/`ScanOptions`/`ScanProblem`, static `ProviderRegistry`
  (duplicate registration is a hard error).
- `agenttidy-provider-api`: `AgentProviderAdapter` trait
  (detect/inspect/capabilities/scan, read-only) and `ProviderInspection`
  (§10.1 pre-scan facts: schema versions, journal modes, agent-running flag,
  unknown structures). Cleanup-unit methods intentionally deferred to Phase 6.

### Fixed (Phase 1 code review)

- `ProviderId` now validates on `Deserialize` as well as on `parse` — the
  closed-set invariant holds on the wire/IPC path, not just in-process
  construction (previously any string round-tripped through serde).
- `AgentProviderAdapter` is now dyn-compatible (via `async-trait`: boxed
  `Send` futures, `Send + Sync` supertraits) — the documented
  `ProviderRegistry<Box<dyn AgentProviderAdapter>>` wiring now compiles.
- `SizeInfo::merge` confidence now follows the weakest contributor: any
  unmeasured (`Unknown`) side makes the aggregate `Unknown` instead of
  `Estimated`, matching `opt_add`'s no-partial-sums stance.
- `AgentSnapshot::total_logical_bytes` replaced by `total_size()` returning
  `SizeInfo` — totals carry confidence and no longer silently count
  unmeasured resources as trustworthy zeros.
- `SessionLifecycle::Archived.archived_at` is `Option<u64>` (epoch ms)
  instead of `Option<serde_json::Value>`, matching `created_at`/`updated_at`
  and enabling the §11.1 "archived + inactive > 30d" rule.
- Removed `Session::supports_archive` (core-side hardcoded provider list) —
  archive support is a provider-reported fact via `CapabilityTopic::Archive`.
- `CapabilityStatus` and `InstallationStatus` now derive `Ord` with
  worst-to-best declaration order, making their documented ordering claims
  real (`max()` picks the strongest).
- Registry doc corrected: duplicate registration returns
  `Err(DuplicateProvider)`, it does not panic.
- `docs/providers/codex.md`: ChatGPT-dir recognition deferred — v0.1 only
  scans known provider roots, and the closed `ProviderId` set has no
  "known non-target app" representation yet.

### Added (Phase 2: infrastructure)

`crates/infrastructure` is now live (was a 7-line placeholder). The
crate exposes provider-neutral platform services with platform code
confined to `#[cfg]` branches inside its modules (red line #11).
Everything in Start.md §13.1 is implemented:

- **Path safety** (`paths`): `safe_canonicalize` (verbatim-stripped
  Windows canonical form), `strip_verbatim` (`\\?\C:\x` ↔ `C:\x`,
  `\\?\UNC\…` ↔ `\\…`), `normalize_drive_letter` (`c:` → `C:`),
  `is_within` (component-based containment, strict-descendant,
  Windows case-insensitive / macOS case-sensitive — the asymmetry is
  deliberately the conservative direction per §16.1), and
  `has_reserved_component` (`CON`/`PRN`/… — Windows-only).
- **Read-only filesystem probing** (`fs_probe`): `walk_tree` over
  `walkdir` with `follow_links(false)` — symlinks/junctions are
  returned as `EntryKind::Link` (never followed), Windows cloud
  reparse-point dirs and Unix special files are `EntryKind::Unknown`
  (caller fails closed). Each file carries `FileIdentity` (Windows
  `BY_HANDLE_FILE_INFORMATION` via `CreateFileW` with `FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT`;
  Unix `dev`/`ino`) and `allocated_len` (Windows `GetCompressedFileSizeW`,
  Unix `st_blocks * 512`).
- **Size aggregation** (`disk_usage`): `UsageAccumulator` dedupes
  hard links by identity (§8), reports
  `hardlink_duplicates_skipped` and `unidentifiable_files`, and drops
  `allocated_bytes` to `None` on any unmeasured contribution (no
  fake precision).
- **Streaming JSONL** (`jsonl`): `open_jsonl`/`JsonlReader` — per-line
  events (`Item`/`Malformed`/`Fatal`); empty lines and parse errors
  are surfaced, never abort the stream.
- **Read-only SQLite** (`sqlite`): `ReadOnlyDb::open` does `mode=ro`
  URI open and falls back to a **private temp copy** of `db` + `-wal`
  + `-shm` opened rw on *our* copy when WAL recovery or a busy
  lock blocks the direct read. `journal_mode` and `quick_check_ok`
  surface §10.1 inspection facts. URI encoder percent-encodes
  provider-realistic paths (spaces, CJK).
- **Process signals** (`processes`): `ProcessSignature`
  (`exe_names` + `cmdline_substrings`) and `any_process_running`,
  driven by `sysinfo` 0.30 — deliberately narrow, never a decision
  (§16.2: one signal among several).
- **Trash** (`trash`): `move_to_trash` wrapping `trash` crate (Windows
  Recycle Bin / macOS NSWorkspace). Missing path = `TrashError::NotFound`
  (fail closed); locked files surface as `TrashError::Platform` for the
  Phase 6 executor to mark `skipped`.

Tests: 31 in infrastructure (31 pass on Windows). Workspace total:
55 tests pass. `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets
-- -D warnings` clean.

New workspace deps: `walkdir`, `rusqlite` (bundled), `trash`, `sysinfo`,
`windows-sys` (Win32_Storage_FileSystem, Win32_Foundation, Win32_Security —
last one gates `CreateFileW`'s `SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES` signature).
