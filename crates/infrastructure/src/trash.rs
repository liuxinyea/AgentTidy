//! Platform-native move-to-trash (`Start.md` §3.4, §16.4).
//!
//! "Trash first" is the default disposal path for file-shaped cleanup:
//! recovery is delegated to the OS (Windows Recycle Bin / macOS
//! Finder Trash) and AgentTidy never claims an in-app undo it cannot
//! honor (§16.4). The `trash` crate wraps the platform APIs
//! (`SHFileOperation`/`IFileOperation` on Windows, `NSWorkspace` on
//! macOS).
//!
//! §16.2 note: on Windows a file held open by another process cannot
//! be moved — this surfaces as an `Err` here; the Phase 6 executor
//! maps it to `skipped`, never to a force-close or a delayed delete.
