//! Provider adapter contracts (`Start.md` §10).
//!
//! This crate defines the `AgentProviderAdapter` interface: the boundary
//! between AgentTidy core and per-agent providers. Providers describe
//! facts, resource relationships, operations and preconditions — they
//! never decide cleanup policy (red lines #2, #3).
//!
//! Phase 1 status: the trait shape and inspection types are defined;
//! adapter implementations land in Phase 3 (`providers/` crates) on top of
//! infrastructure services (Phase 2). Cleanup-unit methods
//! (`build_cleanup_units` / `validate_cleanup_unit`, §10) are deferred to
//! Phase 6 — they are intentionally absent so the v0.1 read-only API
//! surface cannot grow execution semantics prematurely.
