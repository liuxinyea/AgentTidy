# Safety Notes

Path security rules, active-data protection, operation logging and recovery
semantics (design doc §16). The general cleanup execution contract — risk
vocabulary, revalidation triggers, two confirmations, audit log — lives in
[`workspace-cleanup.md`](./workspace-cleanup.md) and applies to every
cleanup-capable resource type.

Each cleanup-capable resource type must get its own document here before
its cleanup is enabled. Current status:

| Resource type | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Default workspaces (`file-tree`) | Documented; **not enabled** (Phase 6 framework only, enablement deferred — see the doc's status note). |
| Session transcripts (`file-set`) | Not documented, not enabled (Phase 7 candidate). |
| Provider DB records (`provider-operation`) | Not documented, not enabled (Phase 7 candidate). |
